=====================

Game: Ninja Battle

This will be a 2-D scrolling Platformer. Instead of jumping or eating mushroom, the game focuses more on fighting.The player has an avatar of ninja who obtains different skills. The purpose of this game is to defeat enemies using these skills. These skills require energy( magic points) so it's not infinite .Different kinds of enemies  may be vulnerable to different kinds of skills. So how to use the limited energy to defeat enemies efficiently would be the challenge to the player in the first half of game.


The second half is the boss battle. after exploring the map and arriving the boss room, there comes the boss battle.The ways to fight boss is different. Player needs to read moves and grab chances to attack. This is designed as the second level.


The mechanics is similar to any fight game. During the game, player uses keyboard to control the avatar. Different skills or different attack have different effective range. It is the same for the normal enemies and the boss. As a result, attacking precisly and avoiding enemies' attack last the whole game. 


I wish to come up with a story to support but telling a good story requires related graphics. ( You can't just draw a pink square and convince your players that this is Zelda Princess.) So the storyline is just a ninja smashes other ninjas because I get rough ninja pictures from a amateur website.
